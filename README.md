# covid-prison-cases-gui
JavaFX GUI displaying analysis of 2020 COVID-19 prison case dataset. 

This interface is the result of an analysis on The Marshall Projectâ€™s COVID-19 in Prisons dataset. The interface only draws on data from the ending of March 2021. The dataset includes total vaccinations, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and prison and staff populations at the state and federal levels. This GUI allows you to look up the percentage of COVID-19 cases that resulted in deaths by state, the national average cases for staff and prisoners, and partial vaccination percentages by state.
